## üìñ Description

- This is an iOS application, inspired from my immense passion for the English language, particularly the complex lexical resource (vocabulary) it encompasses :))
- The main content is essentially a Game Board divided into 6 rows, along with a self-designed keyboard interface for users to input 5-letter words as their guesses
- The resources that drive the operation of this game is a simple text file containing 3000+ English words containing 5 letters (susceptible to future additions) and several logic processing files to supply the main view with a randomly-generated word everytime a new game is invoked by the player!
