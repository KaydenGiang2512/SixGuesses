<p align="center">"The WORDLE sensation all linguists know and love, remastered on the best tech platform (Apple)"</p>

## üìñ Description

- This is an iOS application, inspired from my immense passion for the English language, particularly the complex lexical resource (vocabulary) it encompasses :))
- The main content is essentially a Game Board divided into 6 rows, along with a self-designed keyboard interface for users to input 5-letter words as their guesses
- The resources that drive the operation of this game is a simple text file containing 3000+ English words containing 5 letters (susceptible to future additions) and several logic processing files to supply the main view with a randomly-generated word everytime a new game is invoked by the player!
- This game has a ton of interesting features, including:
  + A settings page to adjust the app's color scheme (light, dark or system);
  + A statistics page where the player can review their lifetime stats, along with a cool bar chart display as well;
  + An achievements hub where the player can track the quantity of achievements badges they managed to earn;
  + An instructions page guiding the newbies on how to play (and potentially win) in this WORDLE-type board game;
  + Customized result views corresponding to the player's game status (win or lose);
  + A hyperlink redirecting the player to and external website where they can learn the definition of the word they just tried to guess;
  + An option for the player to share their results via Apple's built-in sharing methods;
  + Ambient background music as well as retro sound effects to add interest throughout the gameplay.
